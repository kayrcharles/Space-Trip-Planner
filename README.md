# Space-Trip-Planner
The following is a C++ program that would take the user through the process of planning a space exploration trip. There are different sets of functions that most hold an input for “choice”. However, in each function, the “choice” equals something different. For example, the function that determines if the user wants an upgrade has a choice that equals extra but in the insurance function choice equals insurance. The user is also prompted to input their desired destination and duration for their trip. Once these are chosen the user will be prompted to answer whether they would want to have extra activities added to their trip. In the end, the user is presented with a clean and organized exploration guide. This code could be adapted for real-life trips as well. ( was a homework assignment )
